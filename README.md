# jev-pruner

A Claude Code plugin that uses TypeSafe's Jev to trim noisy Bash output **after
the command runs, but before its result is sent back to the main LLM**. This
reduces the output carried into later turns without generating a summary.

```text
Claude requests a Bash command → Command runs → Jev prunes stdout → Claude receives the result
```

1. A `tool.call` hook wraps the Bash tool's `next()` result.
2. Stdout of **10,000 estimated tokens or fewer** passes through untouched,
   without reading history, writing an archive, or calling Jev. The gate uses
   `estimateTokens` on raw stdout, not a character count or an exact model tokenizer.
   `minTokens` can raise this threshold but cannot lower it. If Claude already saved
   the output to a file, the hook reads and counts that full output instead of its
   short preview. Errors, JSON/XML/YAML/diff/binary output,
   whole-document commands (`cat`, `jq`, `git diff`, `git show`, `base64`, and
   `openssl`) are left untouched.
3. Output is split into chunks of `chunkLines` lines, capped at 200 chunks;
   lines longer than 2,000 characters are split first.
4. Jev receives `{ context, task, history, command, chunks }`, plus `category` and
   `categoryGuidance` for recognized build/test/install or search/excerpt commands,
   and one noul question
   per chunk: “does any line in this chunk need to remain available?”. A single
   needed line protects the chunk, including values required by earlier
   instructions even when the next reply must not repeat them. `history` includes
   user/assistant text, complete tool inputs, and tool-result text and structured
   data from the current session. Identical results attached to both a tool call
   and a result message are sent once, linked by their tool-use ID.
   Questions are batched so each request stays under 30,000 estimated tokens.
5. History and output share `maxStateTokens`, using a digit-aware estimate.
   History gets at least half the budget, with more available when the current
   output is small. Oversized history is partitioned in order across requests,
   without truncating or omitting message text, tool arguments, or results.
   Individual oversized fields become continuations labeled with their field
   name and character offset. Complete output chunks are grouped to fit alongside
   each history segment. Scoring requests run in parallel within the request
   allowance. A chunk is fully scored only after evaluation against every
   history segment. A `max_tokens_exceeded` response
   retries twice with a halved state budget and repartitions the original history.
6. A chunk stays when **any query** gives it a noul of at least `keepThreshold`, it is first or
   last, it matches an error or warning pattern, or its complete text was not
   scored against every history segment (for example, a single chunk that cannot
   fit beside a segment). No partially shown chunk can be discarded.
7. Each dropped run becomes a marker such as:
   `[fast-jev-output trimmed N lines (M chars); full output: .claude/fast-jev-output/bash-<id>.txt (Read or grep it if needed)]`
8. Before the first scoring request, the complete stdout and stderr are saved
   under the project's `.claude/fast-jev-output/` directory (self-gitignored).
   When Claude already persisted the complete output, that file is reused as the
   archive. Successful pruning replaces Claude's file-preview metadata with the
   retained text and archive footer. Read or scoring failures preserve the original
   result and its file reference. Claude may persist the pruned result again if it
   still exceeds its display limit; the archive footer then lives inside that file.
   A final `[fast-jev-output full output: <path> (Read or grep it if needed)]`
   footer follows the trimmed stdout. Archives persist for later recovery,
   including when scoring ultimately keeps everything or fails.
   Credential-like commands or output are not archived by the plugin; their omission
   markers instruct the agent to re-run the command instead.
9. Any archive write failure, Jev failure, or state that cannot fit leaves the original output untouched.
   Separate inline stderr is left unchanged. Host-persisted output is scored as
   the combined stream supplied by Claude.

The hook reads the current transcript for each command; it does not maintain a
separate history store. Claude Code's `session.messages()` returns the main
conversation's user/assistant messages (up to the newest 4,096), not the system
prompt or a subagent's own transcript. `task` is still a short extract of the
last three user prompts; `history` supplies the earlier instructions and
assistant decisions and tool results as returned by the host, including any
pruning already applied to earlier results. Archived originals are not reloaded.
Partitioning preserves coverage, but a query sees only its own history segment;
facts that require combining distant segments are not guaranteed to be recognized.
More segments and output groups mean more Jev requests.
Library callers can pass the same transcript shape through
`trimOutput({ command, goal, output, messages }, asker)`.

### Command categories

Categories add guidance to the same relevance question; they never mark an entire
command's output as disposable or change the keep threshold.

| Category | Examples | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build, install, test | `npm run build`, `pnpm test`, `npm ci`, `make`, `pytest`, `cargo test` | Ask Jev to retain diagnostics, failing tests, result counts, final status, artifact paths, and task-required values; repeated progress may be dropped. |
| Search or file excerpt | `rg`, `grep`, `git grep`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, `sed` | Treat paths, line numbers, matches, and surrounding source as evidence. Repeated matches can still matter, particularly when the task requires complete results or counts. |
| Whole document | JSON objects/arrays, recognized XML/YAML headers, diffs; `cat`, `bat`, `jq`, `yq`, `git diff`, `git show`, `diff`, `base64`, `openssl` | Preserve the output verbatim without scoring. Format detection takes precedence over a build or search command. |
| Unknown | Custom scripts, unrecognized subcommands, wrappers, pipelines, compound commands | Use the existing general scoring guidance. Existing whole-document safeguards still take precedence. |

Command recognition is deliberately limited to simple invocations. Executable
paths and leading environment assignments are recognized; shell operators,
substitutions, and wrappers fall back to general guidance unless a whole-document
safeguard applies. This is a heuristic, not a shell parser. All categories keep
the strict **over 10,000 estimated tokens** gate. Category guidance counts toward
the state budget in every history segment and output batch.

## Install

The project is named **jev-pruner**, but its current Claude Code plugin and
marketplace identifiers are still `fast-jev-output`. Use those identifiers in
the commands and settings below.

### 1. Enable function hooks and configure your API key

You need Claude Code with early-access function-hook support and a TypeSafe API
key. In your personal Claude Code settings, merge in:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS": "1",
    "TYPESAFE_API_KEY": "<your key>"
  }
}
```

Replace `<your key>` with your TypeSafe API key. Keep it out of version control.
You can also supply `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` through your shell environment or set the
plugin's `apiKey` option. Restart Claude Code after changing the environment
settings.

#### Using OpenRouter instead

Jev is also available through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai). To use an
OpenRouter key, select the provider and supply `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS": "1",
    "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "<your OpenRouter key>"
  },
  "pluginConfigs": {
    "fast-jev-output@fast-jev-output": {
      "options": { "provider": "openrouter" }
    }
  }
}
```

An OpenRouter key (`sk-or-...`) entered as the plugin's `apiKey` option, or found
in `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, also selects OpenRouter without setting `provider`.
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is read only when `provider` is `openrouter`, so a key
exported for other tools does not start sending output to Jev. With a TypeSafe
key and no `provider`, requests go to TypeSafe exactly as before.
See [OpenRouter differences](#openrouter-differences).

Function hooks are early access and may change between Claude Code releases.
The checked-in declarations were generated by Claude Code 2.1.274.

### 2. Install the plugin

Run in your terminal:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add tamaratran/jev-pruner
claude plugin install fast-jev-output@fast-jev-output
```

Start a new Claude Code session after installation.

### 3. Use Claude Code normally

No special prompt is required. When an eligible Bash result is pruned, a toast
reports the reduction and the result includes markers where output was removed.
When saved, those markers point to the full output under
`.claude/fast-jev-output/`, which Claude can read if needed.

Not every long result will be trimmed: important output may be kept in full.

### Local checkout alternative

Instead of the marketplace install, run this from the repository root with your
TypeSafe API key configured as above:

```sh
CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 claude --plugin-dir .
```

## Output the engine saved

When Bash output is too large to show inline, Claude Code saves the whole thing
and hands the model a head-of-file preview — usually the least interesting part.
The plugin prunes that saved file instead, caps the result at
`persistedMaxChars` so it fits inline, and cites the engine's own saved copy in
the markers, so nothing becomes unrecoverable. Set `persistedOutputs` to false
to leave those results alone.

The budget includes omission markers and the archive footer. Error lines and output that could not be
scored are preserved; if they cannot fit, the original result passes through.
Scoring uses complete chunks and allows one initial Jev request plus at most 40
additional requests, shared by scoring, retries, and refinement. Library callers
can change that allowance with `maxScoringRequests`, including zero.

A 76,379-char log went from a 2,227-char preview that did not contain the error
line to 4,013 chars of pruned output that did.

## Configuration

Use `/plugin configure fast-jev-output` inside Claude Code, or merge a
`pluginConfigs` entry into your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "pluginConfigs": {
    "fast-jev-output@fast-jev-output": {
      "options": { "minTokens": 10000, "chunkLines": 20, "keepThreshold": 0.5 }
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `apiKey` | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | TypeSafe or OpenRouter API key; `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` when `provider` is `openrouter` |
| `provider` | unset | `typesafe` or `openrouter`; unset uses TypeSafe unless the key is an OpenRouter key (`sk-or-...`) |
| `baseUrl` | provider endpoint | Jev endpoint URL, for example a proxy |
| `minTokens` | `10000` | Estimated stdout token threshold; minimum 10,000; equality skips pruning |
| `persistedOutputs` | `true` | Prune eligible output saved by Claude |
| `persistedMaxChars` | `8000` | Rendered budget for saved output, including markers and the footer; 0 disables the cap |
| `chunkLines` | `20` | Lines grouped into each Jev decision chunk |
| `keepThreshold` | `0.5` | Minimum Jev probability for a chunk to remain |
| `maxStateTokens` | `25000` | Estimated token budget for the Jev state |
| `model` | `jev-latest` | Jev model name; `jev-latest` is sent to OpenRouter as `~typesafe/jev-latest` |

The old `minChars` option is no longer used; replace it with `minTokens`.

### OpenRouter differences

OpenRouter serves Jev at `https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions` with the
same `{ model, state, questions }` request and the same `answers` shapes, so
chunking, batching, and keep decisions are identical. What differs:

| | TypeSafe | OpenRouter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint | `https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions` (an alpha API) |
| Model | `jev-latest` | `~typesafe/jev-latest`; the response names the resolved version, such as `typesafe/jev-1.13-20260917` |
| Usage | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` | adds `usage.cost` in USD, which the plugin appends to its log line as `cost=$…` |
| Errors | `{"detail": {"error_type": …}}` | `{"error": {"message", "code"}}`; a Jev error such as `max_tokens_exceeded` is wrapped in `message`, and the state-budget retry still recognizes it |
| Limits | TypeSafe rate limits (`429`, `529`) | OpenRouter key credit limits and rate limits, in addition to TypeSafe's |

Neither provider's `429` or `529` is retried; like any failed Jev request, it
leaves the original output untouched. Measured through OpenRouter on real
command output of 51,000 to 557,000 characters (six commands, five runs each, persisted
output budget 8,000 chars): Jev requests took 629 ms p50 and 1.1 s p95; a whole
trim, with its parallel requests, took 2.3 s p50 and 7.6 s p95; a trim cost
$0.0058 on average ($0.012 at most), about $0.04 per million input tokens.

## Data and privacy

Jev receives command output and partitioned conversation context through the TypeSafe
API, or through OpenRouter when that provider is used, to decide what to keep. The main LLM receives the pruned result when trimming
succeeds. Jev requests incur API usage.

Full output is saved locally before the first scoring request. The archive directory
is self-gitignored. Credential-like commands or output detected by the plugin
are not archived; their markers say to re-run the command instead. **This check
only prevents local archiving—it does not redact secrets or prevent content
from being sent to Jev.**

## Tests

Run the offline checks with `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build`.
`npm run validate:plugin` checks the plugin with the installed Claude Code CLI.

For live Jev checks, provide `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment and run
`npm run test:live`. This makes billable requests using synthetic conversation
and output fixtures. Set `JEV_LIVE_PROVIDER=openrouter` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
to run the same checks through OpenRouter. It checks task-dependent retention, tool-result inclusion,
parallel history/output batching, digit-heavy state budgets, paired comparisons
of general versus category guidance on build and search fixtures, and the hook's behavior when Jev
rejects authentication. It runs separately from `npm test` and does not exercise
the Claude Code host itself.

### Long Claude Code session

With an authenticated Claude CLI and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment, run
`npm run test:long-session`. This starts one continuous Claude process, loads the
production plugin plus a test-only observer, and runs a bootstrap followed by
40 noisy Bash commands against synthetic fixtures. Both Claude and Jev incur
API usage; the Claude process has a $10 budget. Each prompt explicitly confirms
the finite benchmark because Claude may otherwise decline the repeated
simulated failures. If a stage contains no tool call, the runner sends one
direct confirmation in the same session; a second refusal stops the run.
Confirmations are saved in the evidence and counted as additional user turns.
The one-command-per-stage and retention assertions still apply.
Set `JEV_LONG_SESSION_BUDGET_USD` to override the Claude cap for longer runs,
for example `JEV_LONG_SESSION_TURNS=100 JEV_LONG_SESSION_BUDGET_USD=25 npm run test:long-session`.
The selected cap and stage count are saved with the evidence; the cap excludes Jev charges.

`npm run test:archive-recovery` runs a separate two-turn Claude session. It checks
that an unpredictable cache hash is absent from the compacted output, then asks
Claude to recover it using `Read` and the archive footer. Each CLI invocation
has a $2 Claude cap; this billable test requires the same authentication as the
long-session test.

The test checks early requirements, tool-result inclusion,
target bundle and rollback retention, archives, stderr, history partitioning, and
the final answer. Conversation text that quotes tool output is preserved.
Raw events and header-free Jev request/response captures are saved under
`~/jev-long-sessions/`. The path is printed when the run starts.

Run `npm run report:long-session -- <evidence-directory>` to generate a
self-contained HTML evidence report. For a quick harness smoke check,
set `JEV_LONG_SESSION_TURNS=2`; runs of at least 40 stages require history-partitioning coverage.
Use `JEV_LONG_SESSION_DIR` to choose a different persistent output directory.
The long test is separate from the offline suite and `test:live`.
Retention failures produce a failing exit status and a summary containing all
misses. To reanalyze saved evidence without making API calls, run
`npm run test:long-session -- --analyze <evidence-directory>`.

Related: [fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction)
(same author) applies Jev to session compaction; the two are independent and
can be installed together.

## Animated demo (macOS)

`demo/JevPrunerDemo` matches the dark terminal, scanning beam and collapsing
output of the fast-jev-compaction demo. An `npm install` is followed by a scan,
pruning, and a pause on the retained summary. The terminal's top bar
shows estimated output tokens. There are no surrounding captions or sidebar.
Retained text stays verbatim and a saved-log card shows where the original
output can be read.

`npm-install.json` records each output line's arrival time and the process
duration from an actual install of a small React project with
`npm_config_loglevel=verbose`; the displayed command remains `npm install`.
Machine-specific CLI, log-file and working-directory metadata were removed.
The original install takes **4.648 seconds**. Playback shortens gaps between
visible output arrivals to at most **0.35 seconds**, so the preview does not
appear stalled while unshown lines arrive. Shorter intervals retain their
recorded timing. The same time mapping drives the token count and completion.
The install now plays in approximately **1.85 seconds**; the complete animation
is approximately **5.6 seconds**, including scanning, a smooth shared collapse
and a 1.25-second final hold.

Representative rows append and stay in place, instead of cycling a scrolling
viewport or switching to a different layout at completion. The status labels
the shortened pauses. Export plays once; Space manually replays the native app.

This is recorded playback, not a live install or benchmark; it makes no API
requests. The pruning animation and keep/drop decisions are illustrative at
line granularity, rather than the default 20-line chunks.
Token estimates use one token per four characters of the capture and the
illustrated compact text, including its archive marker; they are not measured
model usage. Omission markers are shortened for readability.
The full-output path uses the plugin's existing `fast-jev-output` directory.

Requires macOS 14+ and the Xcode command-line tools. No extra packages are needed.

```sh
demo/JevPrunerDemo/build.sh             # build and open; Space replays
demo/JevPrunerDemo/build.sh --no-launch # build without opening a window
demo/JevPrunerDemo/build.sh --export "$PWD/demo/JevPrunerDemo/build/jev-pruner.mp4"
demo/JevPrunerDemo/build.sh --frame 5 "$PWD/demo/JevPrunerDemo/build/poster.png"
```

Export renders the same timeline directly to a 1100×720 H.264 MP4 at 30 fps.
Use a new output filename for each movie export; existing movies are not
overwritten. Build products and exports under the demo's `build/` are ignored.
